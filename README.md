# Static Website
## Manually deploy static website into S3 bucket with HTTP hosting and CloudFront

Deploy a static website to AWS. Create a S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies. Upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.
